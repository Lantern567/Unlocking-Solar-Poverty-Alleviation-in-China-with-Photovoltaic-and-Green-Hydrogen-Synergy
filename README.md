# Unlocking Solar Poverty Alleviation in China with Photovoltaic and Green Hydrogen Synergy

This repository contains the data, methods, and results for the research project on "Unlocking Solar Poverty Alleviation in China with Photovoltaic and Green Hydrogen Synergy".

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories: `data`, `methods`, and `results`.

### `/data`

This directory stores all data used in the project.

-   **`/data/raw_data`**: Contains original, unprocessed datasets.
    -   `gis_data`: Geospatial information (e.g., solar radiation, land use, poverty maps).
    -   `economic_data`: Economic indicators, costs of PV and hydrogen technologies.
    -   `policy_data`: Relevant policy documents and subsidy information.
    -   `survey_data`: Survey data, if applicable.
-   **`/data/processed_data`**: Contains cleaned, transformed, or intermediate datasets.
    -   `aggregated_data`: Data aggregated to specific regions or units.
    -   `model_inputs`: Datasets ready for model input.
-   **`/data/literature_data`**: Data extracted from literature.

### `/methods`

This directory contains all scripts, models, and methodological descriptions.

-   **`/methods/modeling`**: Scripts and details related to the models used.
    -   `pv_potential_assessment`: Scripts for photovoltaic potential assessment.
    -   `hydrogen_production_simulation`: Scripts for green hydrogen production simulation.
    -   `economic_viability_analysis`: Scripts for economic viability analysis.
    -   `poverty_alleviation_impact`: Methods/scripts for assessing poverty alleviation impact.
-   **`/methods/data_processing_scripts`**: Scripts used to process raw data into processed data.
-   **`/methods/analysis_scripts`**: Scripts for statistical analysis or generating results.
-   **`/methods/workflow_diagrams`**: Diagrams illustrating the methodological workflow.

### `/results`

This directory contains the outputs and findings of the project.

-   **`/results/figures`**: Generated figures and plots.
    -   `maps`: Geospatial result maps.
    -   `charts`: Other graphical representations.
-   **`/results/tables`**: Tables summarizing key findings.
-   **`/results/reports`**: Any interim or final reports.
-   **`/results/supplementary_results`**: Additional results not in the main manuscript but potentially in supplementary information.
-   **`/results/presentations`**: Slides or materials for presenting research findings.
